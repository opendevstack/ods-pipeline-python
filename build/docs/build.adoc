Builds Python applications.

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline-python/blob/main/build/images/scripts/build.sh[build/images/scripts/build.sh].

In particular, the Python source files are expected to be located in `src`.

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `coverage.xml`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`

Instead of the built-in script, one can also specify a build script located
in the Git repository using the `build-script` task parameter. This allows
full control of building and testing, including any generation of artifacts.
Note that some other task parameters have no effect when a custom build
script is used, unless they are handled properly in the script. At a
minimum, the custom script should place its outputs in the directory
identified by `output-dir`.
